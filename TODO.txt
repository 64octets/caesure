TODO
----

* SIGHASH_NONE, etc..
* getheaders.
* hardening.
* sanity check hashes of known blocks
* script for downloading bootstrap.dat & matching utxo.bin.
* test suites.  
* match compiler
* investigate using our own copy of ripemd160 (using the one in 'hashlib' is a back-door openssl dep.)

ledger
======

caesure uses a persistent data structure (a functional AA tree) to
implement a 'many worlds' approach to the UTXO database.  Within an
area at the front of the chain, each block/fork has its own version of
the ledger, each with a separate history.  Each fork updates
independently.  When a dead fork has fallen far enough behind, its
ledger data is abandoned.

A faster, stl-based data structure is used for the initial scan.  The
plan is to distribute paired 'blocks.dat' and 'utxo.bin' files via
bittorrent.

memory requirements: Oct 2014, ~3GB.


in progress
-----------
* ledger: final task remains - connecting the many-worlds ledger to txn flow.

done
----
* getdata/blocks: before txns, let's forward blocks.
* proper package installation and directory for blocks.bin etc...
* use html_help module.
* getblocks.
* p2sh.
