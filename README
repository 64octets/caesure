python bitcoin client

requirements: a relatively recent python, probably 2.5+ or so.

status:
can connect to a server - preferably on the same host - and download the latest blocks.
stores the block chain in a simple flat file.
doesn't understand ecdsa yet, so it can't actually touch real bitcoins.

note: this is *not* a JSON/RPC client, it's an implementation of the bitcoin protocol.
