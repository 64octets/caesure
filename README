Caesure: a python bitcoin client

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

note: this is *not* a JSON/RPC client, it's an implementation of the bitcoin protocol.

requirements: a relatively recent python, probably 2.5+ or so
either: A) an openssl library.
        B) the pure-python ecdsa package.

I have tested this code using openssl on osx 10.6 (64-bit), linux ubuntu (32-bit), and freebsd-7 (64-bit).

status:

It can connect to a server - preferably on the same host - and download the latest blocks.  stores
the block chain in a simple flat file.  The wallet can store private keys, and can monitor the block
chain for transactions related to those keys.  You can also scan the entire block database (or a
portion of it) for related transactions.

todo:

There's still a lot of work to be done before I would consider it safe to connect
this to the wider bitcoin p2p network.  In the meanwhile, 

name:

It's a pun on the words Caesar and Seizure.  "Render unto Caesar..."

usage:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$ python bitcoin.py -c <your-external-ip-address> <other-ip-address>

I recommend connecting to a bitcoin client on your local machine, i.e., 127.0.0.1.

Once the client connects to the server it will start to download the block
database.  This will take a while, even if you're talking to localhost.

You can monitor the progress like this:

from another terminal:
$ telnet localhost 8023

you'll get a python prompt:

>>> the_block_db
<__main__.block_db instance at 0x43bdc8>
>>> db = _
>>> len(db.blocks)
10123
>>> 
>>> len(db.blocks)
18539
>>> 
>>> len(db.blocks)
66029
>>> 
[...]

IMPORTANT NOTE:  If you're running this on a multi-user machine, the python prompt
sitting on port 8023 will be a bad idea.  You have two choices: remove the line that
starts that server (near the bottom of the file, "m = monitor.monitor_server()"),
*or*, if your operating system supports it, bind the socket to an AF_UNIX socket and
telnet to that file.

The monitor interface is there to speed up development, and will eventually be
removed completely - probably replaced by a web admin interface.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

web admin.

In client mode ('-c'), a web admin server is also started up on localhost:
try http://localhost:8380/admin/ (note: that trailing slash is important)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

testnet.

To use testnet, give the '-t' argument along with '-c'.  This will change several
global values, and should NOT impact your block database - it uses different
filenames.  HOWEVER you should use a different wallet path (the '-w' argument).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wallet:

To have access to a wallet, use: [-w <wallet-path>]

$ python bitcoin.py -w wallet.bin
NOTE: NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE OFFICIAL CLIENT WALLET.DAT

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rather than running a client, you can just start up python and play with the block
database.  Both the block database and wallet files are written in append-only mode,
so it's safe to open them read-only from another process, even while the client is
running.

$ python -i bitcoin.py -w wallet.bin

--- receiving bitcoins ---
Just leave the client running.  Once the send shows up in a block, it will be seen
by the wallet and any associated outputs will be reflected in your wallet.

--- sending bitcoins ---
[this needs to be done via the back door so you have access to the client connection]

>>> w = _
>>> w.total_btc

You should verify the inputs before sending on...
>>> tx.verify (0)
1
>>> tx.verify (1)

>>> packet = make_packet ('tx', tx.render())

This will actually send the packet.
>>> bc

>>> bc.push (packet)

Any change that's sent back to you will be acknowledged once it makes it into
a block.
